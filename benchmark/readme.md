Benchmark
=========

The goal of this project is to help comparing and analysing the performance of running dbt Core, dbt Cloud and dbt in Airflow with Astronomer Cosmos. As a starting point the tests are being run using the Airflow Helmchart - but the idea is that in future we'll extend these tests to also compare the performance in Astro Cloud.

The perfomance is analysed from three perspectives:

* Time to complete the execution of the DAG
* Total memory consumed
* Total vCPU consumed

These metrics can be extended over time. One component we would like to evaluate in future, fpr 

For the tests to be fair, except for dbt Cloud (since we don't control it), we will run them using a similar "hardware". The tests will be run in a pod in a Kubernetes cluster with the same values for resources and limits.

As a starting point, we are running the tests against a local Kubernetes cluster, but if we want a further level of isolation, we could run them against any managed cluster.

Requirements
------------

Install the following tools:
* Docker or equivalent tool.
* Kind

Create a file called `key.json` inside the folder `benchmark/pre-process`, which contains the credentials to access the BigQuery instance of interest. While we are running locally, this approach is acceptable. If we are using a hosted K8s cluster, we should use K8s secrets or another more secure approach.

Update the `profiles.yml`  file in the pre-process to reference your BigQuery dataset and related Google project.

Analysing performance
---------------------

As a first step, we'll analyse dbt-core commands performance.
This approach will be extended to run Airflow.

To run this analysis, run the following scripts:

1. Firstly, run the pre-process, by running:

```
./setup.sh
```

This command will
- create a K8s cluster with Kind
- build the docker image with dbt Core, the dbt project and credentials to access the Data Warehouse
- make the docker image available to the K8s cluster
- install Prometheus in the cluster, so we can fetch metrics
- expose Prometheus in the host via port 9090

2. Second, run the experiments of interest by running:

```
./run-test.sh
```

Each experiment is defined as K8s jobs in the folder `experiment`. By default, we will run two types of experiment:
- Run the `dbt build` command against the dbt project `fhir-dbt-analytics`
- Run the `dbt run` command against the dbt project `fhir-dbt-analytics`

Each experiment will be run 3 times.

For each experiment, the following is done:
- create a K8s job
- execute the K8s job in the Kind cluster
- collect the metrics for that job
- delete the job

The experiments run and the amount of repetitions can be configured by setting the variables via command line, as illustrated below:
```
JOBS="dbt-core-build dbt-core-run" REPS=3 ./run-test.sh
```

The jobs made available, as a starting point, are:
- dbt-core-build
- dbt-core-run
- dbt-core-seed
- dbt-core-test

3. The collected metrics are printed in the terminal, example:

```
=== Run #1 for dbt-core-build ===
Start time: 2025-10-07T03:33:24-0700
job.batch "dbt-core-build" deleted
job.batch/dbt-core-build created
job.batch/dbt-core-build condition met
End time: 2025-10-07T03:38:10-0700
Fetching metrics for pod: dbt-core-build-54h4q

Metrics for Pod: dbt-core-build-54h4q (last 240h)
----------------------------------------------
Max CPU Utilization (cores):    0.13957793105490057
Stddev CPU Utilization (cores): 0.02129759725801408
Max Memory Usage:     402 MiB
Stddev Memory Usage:  83 MiB
Job Duration: 00:04:44
